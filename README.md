First Repository

In my free time I like to just see what I can do with the skills I've aquired so far. So on my own time I created this database on my local. The database started with 8 NBA basketball teams (4 East, 4 West) with 5 players on each team. Each player has a rating for various skills. When I first began, all I wanted to achieve was have each team play every other team once and have a winner. 

It started just based on the total combined rating of the players skills. But as my own skills increased, so did the complexity of my database. 
I did more and more until now I have a regular season, and playoffs. There are now 24 teams, and obvious many more players. Games are won and lost based on an algorithm that determines how many points a player scores based on their skills ratings. Then the team sums each players' score for a final score.

Let's just see where this goes.
