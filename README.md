First Repository

In my free time I like to just see what I can do with the skills I've aquired so far. So on my own time I created this database. The database started with 8 NBA basketball teams (4 East, 4 West) with 5 players on each team. Each player has a rating for various skills. When I first began, all I wanted to achieve was have each team play every other team once and have a winner. 

It started just based on the total combined rating of the players skills. But as my own skills increased, and my mind thought of new ideas, so did the complexity of this. 

I did more and more until now a regular season and playoffs are set up. There are 24 teams, and obviously many more players. Games are won and lost based on an algorithm that determines how many points/assists/rebounds a player scores based on their skills ratings. Then the team sums each players' score for a final score.

I recently created a fantasy league within the database. It has fantasy users and selects random players from different teams and puts them together to see which combination can get the most points based on individual performance.
